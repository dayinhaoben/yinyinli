			<p><b>Blog/web site<br></b>
				PHP, MySQL, HTML, DIV+CSS, Javascript</p>

			<p>Description: The whole web project has two versions: responsive and nonresponsive.</p>
			<p>The project made up by two main parts which are user and admin. 
On user pages contains Home, Excel Guide, About Us and Contact sections.<br>
Pages are structured by template php files, such as header.php, leftBox.php. The header.php has navibar which response for the link of different pages. The leftBox.php is mainly response for getting the articles' titles from the database and shows them in list. By click each link, it will give the article id to Excel Guide page and show the related articles on the main part. Under each articles, it will have a comment function which allows user to give some feed back by reading the articles. When you send the comment, it will tell you if you have done successfully and the page will update itself. If you send message on contact page, it will automatically goes to the admin's email.</p> 
<p>On admin part, first it will have a page to put the username and password to access in admin pages. For now admin part contain three function which are compose new articles (when you submit the article it will goes to database directly), article management (list of all articles in your database, you can manage them such as delete and change articles), comment management which is similar to article management.</p>

<p>Plus: The link of the project is for people who wants to check the code. But the database is not attached in the source.</p>
